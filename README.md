  - The peak period for sales is in the morning and late in the afternoon while Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays are peak days for sales.
  - 97% of transactions are by card which is great for loyalty programs.
  - 1,316 unique customers which suggests good customer base.
  - There was a significant decrease in sales from 2024 to 2025.
    
  ### Recommendations
  - Increase staffing during peak hours and days.
  - Track loyal customers (using card IDs) and reward frequent buyers.
  - Offer discounts for customers in slower hours to drive sales.
  - Stock up more on high-demand products/raw materials.
  - For less popular items, consider seasonal promotions or removing underperforming ones.
